## [1.1.3] - 2025-08-05

### API Sync Foundation

This release lays the groundwork for syncing without opening the Emoji Studio app.

  - Changes to how Emoji Studio app loads data
- For now, users still need to open Emoji Studio at least once to store data in localStorage
- This serves as a foundation for future true server-side sync capabilities
