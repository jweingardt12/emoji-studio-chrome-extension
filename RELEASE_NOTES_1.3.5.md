# Release Notes - Version 1.3.5

## Real-Time Sync Progress

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Live Sync Progress**: Loading overlay now shows actual sync progress in real-time
- **Smart Loading States**: Loading overlay appears automatically when sync starts and disappears when complete
- **Better User Feedback**: Users can see exactly when syncing is happening and when it's finished

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Message Broadcasting**: Extension now broadcasts sync status to all open Emoji Studio tabs
- **Real-time Communication**: Chrome extension communicates sync progress through message passing
- **Unified Loading Experience**: Single loading overlay handles all sync states consistently

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Accurate Progress**: Removed fake progress simulation, now shows actual sync status
- **No More Duplicate Overlays**: Fixed issue where multiple loading overlays could appear simultaneously
- **Proper State Management**: Loading overlay state is now properly synchronized with actual sync operations

## How It Works
1. When you click "Refresh Data" or sync happens automatically, the loading overlay appears immediately
2. Progress updates in real-time as the extension communicates with Slack
3. Success state shows when sync completes with actual emoji count
4. Error states display meaningful messages if sync fails

## Who Should Update
All users will benefit from this update as it provides much better feedback during sync operations. No more wondering if the sync is actually working!
