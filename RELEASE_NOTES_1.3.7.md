# Release Notes - Version 1.3.7

## Fixed Sync Button Functionality

### üêõ What Was Broken
- Clicking the "Sync" button in the green notification didn't open the Emoji Studio dashboard
- No loading overlay was shown during the sync process when using the sync button
- Users couldn't see sync progress when clicking sync from the notification

### ‚úÖ What's Fixed
- **Dashboard Opens Immediately**: Clicking sync button now opens the Emoji Studio dashboard right away
- **Loading Overlay Shows**: Real-time loading overlay appears during the entire sync process
- **Better Progress Flow**: Clear progression from "Preparing to sync" ‚Üí "Syncing emojis" ‚Üí "Sync complete"
- **Proper Timing**: Dashboard loads first, then sync starts to ensure progress messages are received

## How It Works Now
1. Click "Sync" button in the green notification
2. Dashboard opens immediately with "Preparing to sync..." message (5% progress)  
3. After 1 second, actual sync begins with "Syncing emojis from [workspace]..." (20% progress)
4. When sync completes, shows "Synced X emojis successfully!" (90% progress)
5. Loading overlay disappears and you can use the dashboard with fresh data

## Technical Implementation
- Uses `?syncStarting=true` URL parameter to trigger immediate loading overlay
- Background script opens dashboard first, then starts sync after 1-second delay
- ChromeExtensionHandler detects sync parameter and shows loading state
- Real-time sync progress messages update the loading overlay throughout the process
- URL parameter is cleaned up automatically after use

## User Experience Improvements
- **Immediate Feedback**: No more wondering if the sync button worked
- **Visual Progress**: Clear indication of sync status throughout the process  
- **Seamless Flow**: Dashboard opens and shows progress without any manual intervention
- **No Tab Management**: Everything happens automatically in the background

## Who Should Update
**All users** should update to this version as it fixes the core sync button functionality. This was a significant usability issue where the main sync workflow wasn't working properly.
